The list of images generated after pre-processing will be used to highlight relevant features in the images hence.
In a conventional FER system, the relevant features are facial features.

For the purpose of feature extraction we will be using Local Binary Patterns (LBP).

In LBP, we focus on 9 pixels (3x3) at a time.
We first compare the neighbouring pixels with the central pixel, and assign a value '0' or '1' to the neighbouring pixel relative to the central pixel.
Doing so we get a set of 8 bits which we can convert into a byte, going either clockwise or anticlockwise.
Further we convert it into a decimal value which is assigned to the central pixel.
The same is done for each pixel of the image, hence, highlighting facial features like eyes,nose,eyebrows and mouth.
